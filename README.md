# Student Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project explores student academic performance using a dataset of 5,000 student records from a private learning provider. The dataset includes demographic information, behavioral traits, and academic scores. The goal is to predict student success using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.

## Objectives

- Predict student performance based on socioeconomic, behavioral, and academic variables
- Apply classification models to identify high vs. low performers
- Explore clustering patterns using unsupervised learning

## Key Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed a mixed-type dataset with 23 features
- Dichotomized academic scores into binary outcomes using the median as a threshold
- Applied and evaluated multiple supervised learning models:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Support Vector Machines  
  - Decision Trees  
  - Random Forests  
  - Na√Øve Bayes  
  - AdaBoost  
- Performed unsupervised learning (KMeans) to explore clustering patterns

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  
- Google Colab
